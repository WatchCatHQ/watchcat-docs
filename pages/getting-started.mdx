# Getting Started

This guide will take you through the process of setting up error reporting and uptime monitoring for your application.

## Step 1: Sign Up or Sign In

First things first, you need a account to get started. If you already have an account, simply [Sign In](https://app.watchcat.io/sign-in).
If you're new to WatchCat, [Sign Up](https://app.watchcat.io/sign-up) to create your account.

## Step 2: Create an Application

Once you're logged in, it's time to create an [Application](/key-concepts#application). An Application in WatchCat represents your unique service or project. Follow these steps to create a new Application:

1. Select `Applications` from the menu on the right.
2. Click the `Create application` button.
3. Enter a name for your application and select your stack.

## Step 3: Install the SDK

Now that your application is set up, it's time to install the appropriate [SDK](/key-concepts#sdk) based on your application's stack. This enables your application to communicate with WatchCat and automatically report errors.
- [__Browser__](/sdk/browser)
- [__Server__](/sdk/server)

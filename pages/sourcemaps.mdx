# Source Maps

To translate a stack trace from bundled code to its original position and obtain meaningful information,
you need to provide source maps (see https://web.dev/source-maps/).

First, ensure that source maps are generated during the build phase. In your build directory, there should be a file ending with `.map`.
For example, for a React build, the output looks like this:

```shell
main.c1411ba0.js
main.c1411ba0.js.map
```

If you don't see such files, please refer to your build tool's documentation.

## Uploading source maps

The easiest way is to install the WatchCat CLI tool:

```shell
npm install @watchcathq/cli --save-dev
```

This tool will recursively search for maps in the specified directory and upload them for a given application, determined by the provided token. The token can be found in the application details at https://app.watchcat.io/applications.

```
watchcat sourcemap [app_token] [directory]
```

Once the source maps are uploaded, you should see a stack trace leading to the original source, and you can quickly identify where the issue lies.

### Example

```shell
watchcat sourcemap app_12345 build/
```

In the example above, `app_12345` is the application token, and `build/` is the directory where the command will recursively search for source maps to upload.

## List of uploaded source maps

You can find a list and the upload dates in the application details at the bottom of the page. To view this:
1. Log in to https://app.watchcat.io.
2. Select `Applications` from the menu on the right.
3. Choose the application for which you wish to see the source maps.

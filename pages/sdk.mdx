# SDK

Choose the right SDK based on the environment your application is running in:

- [__Browser__](/sdk/browser) - If your application runs in a web browser, like a web app or a single page application, you'll need a Browser SDK.

- [__Server__](/sdk/server) -  If your application runs on a server, like an API or a backend service, you'll need a Server SDK.

# Browser SDKs

Browser SDKs are designed for use with a bundler, but if a bundler isn't available, you can also utilize the minimized bundled code via `unpkg.com`.

When using a bundler, Source Maps must be uploaded. This translates a stack trace from the bundled code back to its original position, providing meaningful information.

For more details, see [Source maps](/sourcemaps).

Uptime monitoring can be set up either via the application interface or directly through code. To configure uptime
monitoring through code for one or more URLs, use the `monitors` property. This property can take the following options:

- `url` (required): This is the URL you want to monitor.
- `httpCodes` (optional): Specify the HTTP codes to validate. The format is the same as in the UI, such as `200-204,304`.
- `phrase` (optional): If you want to verify the presence of a particular phrase on the page, enter it here.
- `interval` (optional): This is the test interval. The default value is 30 seconds. Other valid options include 1 minute (1m), 5 minutes (5m), 30 minutes (30m), and 1 hour (1h).

    Monitors will be synchronized at the application start.

Here's an example of how to set up monitor:

```javascript
WatchCat.init({
    token: "APP_TOKEN",
    monitors: [
        { url: "https://watchcat.io", httpCodes: "200-201", phrase: "watchcat", interval: "30s"}
    ]
})
```

Specified monitors that do not exist will be created. If you remove a monitor, it will not be deleted automatically;
you will have to delete it manually in the UI.

If you want to also delete monitors that you have removed from the code, use the `fullMonitorSync` parameter:

```javascript
WatchCat.init({
    //...
    fullMonitorSync: true
})
```

    Setting up monitoring via code is only available for server SDKs.
